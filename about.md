# What is Dear First Year?

Dear First Year is a series of letters and other content written by college upperclassmen and alumni to their first year selves. This project is intended to help incoming college students looking to understand how to make the best of their time in college as well as get some advice from people that were in their shoes not too long ago. Anyone who meets the submitter requirements is welcome to submit to be part of this project.

There is no set prompt, but some great starting places for your submission are:

- If you were a first year again, what would you do differently (if anything)? why?
- What are some of your fondest memories from college? How did those memories impact your college experience?
- What were some of the highs and lows of your college experience?

# Format

All submissions begin with the salutation "Dear First Year" and are signed with your name (or a pseudoname if you wish to post anonymously). While most submissions are in a standard letter format, we also welcome submissions in other formats. This can range from drawings to TikToks to whatever format works best for yourself. 

# Am I eligible to submit?
