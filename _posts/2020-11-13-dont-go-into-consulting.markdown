Dear First Year,

Remember when I said, [don't go into finance](https://www.dearfirstyear.com/posts/dont-go-into-finance)? 

It's basically the same story with consulting but add in waking up at 4AM every week to fly to a random city in the country writing decks that'll often be ignored. 


Shoutout to Alexandra, my Intern Manager/mentor/friend for helping steer me away from this!

Best, 

Will
